# howToGitHub
A test repo to clone and pull (fetch)

1. This is a new comment after pulling the repo and pushing it again.
2. You don't need to create and alias for a repo that was made on github and you're pulling from github.
   * You only need to make an alias if you're making a repo and pushing to it

To check this **`git remote -v`**
