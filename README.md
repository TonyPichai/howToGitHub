# howToGitHub
A test repo to clone and pull (fetch)

* This is a new comment after pulling the repo and pushing it again.
* You don't need to create and alias for a repo that was made on github and you're pulling from github.
      * You only need to make an alias if you're making a repo and pushing to it

To check you repo alias **`git remote -v`** it'll say something like origin
----
Then push
   * **`git add .`**
   * **`git commit -m 'message'`**
   * **`git push origin main`**
     * main, master, whatever your branch is called
